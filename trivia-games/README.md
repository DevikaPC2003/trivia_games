### Project Description

Trivia games are designed to test and enhance knowledge, as well as provide entertainment.  Trivia requires players to recall information from memory, which can help improve cognitive functions, such as recall and retention. 

### The Problem statement
The goal of the trivia game is to provide an engaging and educational experience where players can test and improve their general knowledge across various subjects. The game will challenge players to recall facts and answer questions correctly to earn points, fostering critical thinking, memory recall, and social interaction.

### The Solution
We are creating a solution that blends fun, engaging gameplay, and knowledge testing with exciting questions and telling you at what level you are. To keep the excitement high, players will earn points for answering all questions correctly within a given time.
